# Causal-forest-simulation
The purpose of this repository is for me to play around with, and learn about, causal forests. Causal forests are a class of algorithms that are useful for discerning heterogenous treatment effects â€“ that is, when a treatment affects individuals differently and we care about more than the average treatment response. For example, the effects of a labor policy program might affect certain subgroups differently depending on socio economic characteristics, it could therefore be of interest to learn what groups benefit and what groups are hurt by the policy program.
